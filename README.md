# Basketball

<img src="Assets/Art/Basketball/basketball.png?raw=tru" width="175">

A simple little basketball game I'm working on in Unity. I was playing the basketball minigame in Facebook messenger when I decided it's be fun to try and recreate it on my own. This project should help me get some more experience with Unity physics as well as experiment with general best practices before I try to make a more ambitious game.
